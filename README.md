You can manage profiles, each with a different Riot account, a unique name, and an icon (more customization support coming in the future; it's currently in alpha).

You can launch your game more efficiently, always running it from the root, which also helps avoid various client bugs by ensuring a clean start every time

And remember the most important step: when logging in for the first time, ALWAYS click "Stay Signed In." Don’t forget!

At the start, look for the Riot Client folder, go inside, and confirm to ensure everything works perfectly.

**Please note:** LeagueSwitcher is currently in **alpha**. While we're excited to share it with you, it's still in the early stages of development. Expect regular updates and improvements as we work towards a stable release.
